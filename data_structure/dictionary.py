# 1. Write a program to add key and value of dictionary.
dis={0:10,1:20}
dis[3]=30
print(dis)

# 2. Write a program concatenate following dictionarys to create new one.
# dic1={1:10,2:20}
# dic2={3:30,4:40}
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# dic=dic1| dic2|dic3
# print(dic)

# 3. Write a program to check given  key already exists in dictionary.
# dic={1:10,2:20,3:30,4:40}
# enter_key=3
# if enter_key in dic:
#     print("already exists")

# 4. Write a program to iterate over a dictionary using for loop and print the keys alone, values alone and both keys and values.
# dic1={1:10,2:20,3:30,4:40}
# for r in dic1:
#     print(r)
#     print(dic1[r])

# 5. Write a program to prepare a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of the keys.
# squares = {}
# for num in range(1, 16): 
#     squares[num] = num ** 2

# print(squares)

# 6.Write a program to sum all the values in a dictionary, considering the values will be of int type.

# dict = {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40}

# total = sum(dict.values())
# print("Sum of all values:", total)
